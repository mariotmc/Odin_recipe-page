    <h4>A delicious cheeseburger</h4>

    <p>
      This is a step-by-step guide on how to make a phenomenal cheeseburger
      within the comforts of your own home!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <h3>Burger</h3>
      <li>1 lb ground chuck beef, (80/20)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Black pepper</li>

      <h3>Toppings</h3>
      <li>Burger buns</li>
      <li>Cheddar Cheese (thick sliced)</li>
      <li>Large tomato, sliced into rings</li>
      <li>Green leaf lettuce</li>
      <li>Red onion, thinly sliced into rings</li>
      <li>Dill pickle slices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice, and prepare all of your burger toppings and sauces.</li>
      <li>
        Spread the cut-side of the bun with softened or melted butter and toast
        the cut side on a skillet or on the grill until golden brown. You can
        toast the bun ahead or in the last couple of minutes with the burgers on
        the grill. Toasting the bun adds great flavor and prevents a soggy bun.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat grill to medium heat. Divid beef into 4 portions and form
        patties that are about 1/2" thick and 1" wider than the burger buns.
        Season patties generously with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill burger patties (indent-side-up) covered for 3-5 min each side on
        the grill. Flip burgers when juices are accumulating on top of burger
        and you have a good sear. Apply cheese in the last 1-2 minutes of
        grilling then cover with lid and cook until internal temperature of beef
        reaches 160ËšF.
      </li>
    </ol>
